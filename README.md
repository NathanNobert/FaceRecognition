# FaceRecognition
This project was made while learning and testing the React Javascript Framework.
  
# Running The Project
* Firstly make sure to install the node modules with -> npm i
1. Use ->npm start <- to run this project.  
2. There is no backend setup for this project, so just click sign in once the development server opens.  
3. Find an image online, copy the URL/link address.  
4. Paste it in the text box and click detect.  
5. If the API correctly finds a face, it will place a box around it and increment the score.  
  
# Goal Of The Project
The main reason for doing this project was to get familiar using the React Framework. I also focused on using some more in depth css to practise my front end development skills. This was also the first time I've used an API.  

# Bugs In The Project
-Currently the API does not detect faces, I think this is just an issue with how I connect to the API.  
-No backend is connected so login doesn't contain anything.
